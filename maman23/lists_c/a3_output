C is an imperative procedural language supporting
 structured programming, lexical variable scope, 
and recursion, with a static type system. It was 
designed to be compiled to provide low-level acce
ss to memory and language constructs that map eff
iciently to machine instructions, all with minima
l runtime support. Despite its low-level capabili
ties, the language was designed to encourage cros
s-platform programming. A standards-compliant C p
rogram written with portability in mind can be co
mpiled for a wide variety of computer platforms a
nd operating systems with few changes to its sour
ce code.
