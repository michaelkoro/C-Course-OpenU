age.It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie
, and remains very widely used and influential. B
y design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabi
lities of the targeted CPUs.

It has found lasting use in operating systems, de
vice drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingl
y for application software, and is common in comp
uter architectures that range from the largest su
percomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and
 embedded systems.
