A successor to the programming language B, C was 
originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritch
ie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities r
unning on Unix.

It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of t
he Unix operating system.

During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. 
It has become one of the most widely used program
ming languages, with C compilers available for al
most all modern computer architectures and operat
ing systems. C has been standardized by ANSI sinc
e 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organiza
tion for Standardization (ISO).
